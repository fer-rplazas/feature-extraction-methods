# Exploring Feature Extraction Methods: Code and Figures

This repository accompanies 

Exploring feature-extraction methods for identifying neural states from oscillatory waveforms: experiments on synthetic and real patient data

## Usage:
- The folder `code` implements synthetic data generation as well as the models, and includes two main files (`main_patients.py` and `main_synthetic.py`), which train models for synthetic data and patient data tasks respectively.
- The folder `nbs` includes notebooks with examples and the code used to generate all figures.
